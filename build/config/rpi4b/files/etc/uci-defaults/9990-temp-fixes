# For whatever reason dropbear connections fail on freshly flashed software with "Connection refused"
# It starts working fine when the dropbear service is restarted from UI
# Working theory: network changes cause the dropbear instance to become "obsoleted"
# Let's fix it with restarting the dropbear as the last step for now and investigate later on
# This didn't happen on v22.03.2, but appeared on v22.03.3
