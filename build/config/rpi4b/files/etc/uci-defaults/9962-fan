# TODO: we need to reboot after this operation
# can we do it from here?

# TODO: /boot seems to persist across `firstboot` commands
# we may need a bit more sophisticated approach than just appending to the end of the file
# Probably the best option would be to bake this in the image directly during the build
# Maybe by patching the `target/linux/bcm27xx/image/config.txt` in openwrt build dir,
# before actually starting the build?
